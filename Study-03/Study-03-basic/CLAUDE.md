# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is a newly initialized repository (Study-03) in the VibeCoding workspace. The repository is currently empty and awaiting its first project implementation.

## Related Projects

This repository is part of a series of study projects:

* Study-01: Contains desktop and web versions of an application
* Study-02: Contains a web-based todo application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Project Setup

Since this is an empty repository, the project type and structure will be determined based on the first implementation request. Common project types that may be created here include:

* **Web Application**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript project similar to Study-02
* **Desktop Application**: Potentially using frameworks from Study-01
* **Full-Stack Application**: Backend API with frontend interface
* **Other**: Based on specific requirements

## Initial Development Tasks

When starting a new project in this repository:

1. Determine the project type and requirements from the user
2. Create appropriate directory structure based on the project type
3. Initialize package management if needed (npm, pip, etc.)
4. Set up basic configuration files (.gitignore, etc.)
5. Implement core functionality as requested

## Git Configuration

The repository has been initialized with git. Remember to:

* Create meaningful commits with clear messages
* Use proper .gitignore patterns for the project type
* Only commit when explicitly requested by the user
